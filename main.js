// Comparisons
// - Similar to other languages except

/*
  - There are two equalities:
        - == is for regular equality, converts both operands to same type
        - === is for strict equality, where both operands must be similar
        
   - Null and Undefined:
        - when Null == Undefined, it is true (This does not hold for other comparisons!)
        - when Null === Undefined, it is false

    - String comparisons:
        - compares each letter/character in the string by their unicode according to ASCII
